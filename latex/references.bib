  abstract = {Bad Smells are certain suboptimal structures or patterns in software. They can cause maintenance issues and hinder understandability. Therefore, it is essential to avoid Bad Smells in software. While the topic is well researched in other fields, it is still an open issue in industrial automation. In this work, we are taking a step towards closing that gap and propose a catalog of IEC 61499 Bad Smells.},

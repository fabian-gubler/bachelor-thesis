          2 Language and Writing Style
           This chapter is an adopted version of a single chapter of Andrews thesis
           template Andrews, 2011 in its version from 2011-12-11.
           The reason why Andrews, 2011 is not recommended to be used instead
                                           A
           of this template is its more “traditional” LT X implementation. But the
                                             E
           information contained regarding “How to write a thesis” is generally
           brilliant and worth reading.
           Using this chapter here is meant as a teaser. If you do like this chapter,
           please go and download the full template to read its content: Andrews,
           2011.
           Whatwasmodiﬁedfromtheoriginal chapter:
              • strikethrough of bad examples
              • minor typographical details
              • technical modiﬁcations
                  – moved citations from \citet{} and \citep{} to \textcite{}
                   and \cite{}
                  – changed quoting style to \enquote{}
                  – created various commands and environments to encapsulate
                   format
          The classic reference for English writing style and grammar is Strunk and
          White (1999). The original text is now available for free online Strunk, 1918,
          so there is no excuse at all for writing poor English. Readers should consult
          it ﬁrst, then continue reading this chapter. Another good free guide is
          McCaskill (1998).
                                                                  3
                         2 Language and Writing Style
                         Zobel (2004) and Dupré (1998) are guides speciﬁcally aimed at computer
                         science students. Phillips and Pugh (2005) gives practical advice for PhD
                         students.
                         The following Sections 2.3 and 2.4 are adapted from the CHI’94 language
                         and writing style guidelines.
                         2.1 Some Basic Rules of English
                         ThereareafewbasicrulesofEnglishforacademicwriting,whicharebroken
                         regularly by my students, particularly if they are non-native speakers of
                         English. Here are some classic and often encountered examples:
                            • Never use I, we, or you.
                              Write in the passive voice (third person).
                                Bad:   You can do this in two ways.
                                Good:  There are two ways this can be done.
                            • Never use he or she, his or her.
                              Write in the passive voice (third person).
                                Bad:   The user speaks his thoughts out loud.
                                Good:  The thoughts of the user are spoken out loud.
                               See Section 2.4 for many more examples.
                            • Stick to a consistent dialect of English. Choose either British or Ameri-
                               can English and keep to it throughout the whole of your thesis.
                            • Donot use slang abbreviations such as “it’s”, “doesn’t”, or “don’t”.
                              Write the words out in full: “it is”, “does not”, and “do not”.
                                Bad:   It’s very simple to...
                                Good:  It is very simple to...
                            • Donot use abbreviations such as “e.g.” or “i.e.”.
                              Write the words out in full: “for example” and “that is”.
                                Bad:   . . . in a tree, e. g.the items...
                                Good:  . . . in a tree, for example the items...
                         4
                                                         2.1 Some Basic Rules of English
                • Donot use slang such as “a lot of”.
                   Bad:    There are a lot of features...
                   Good:   There are many features...
                • Donot use slang such as “OK” or “big”.
                   Bad:    . . . are represented by big areas.
                   Good:   . . . are represented by large areas.
                • Donot use slang such as “gets” or “got”.
                  Use “becomes” or “obtains”, or use the passive voice (third person).
                   Bad:    The radius gets increased...
                   Good:   The radius is increased...
                   Bad:    The user gets disoriented...
                   Good:   The user becomes disoriented...
                • Never start a sentence with “But”.
                  Use “However,” or “Nevertheless,”. Or consider joining the sentence
                  to the previous sentence with a comma.
                   Bad:    But there are numerous possibilities...
                   Good:   However, there are numerous possibilities...
                • Never start a sentence with “Because”.
                  Use “Since”, “Owing to”, or “Due to”. Or turn the two halves of the
                  sentence around.
                • Neverstartasentencewith“Also”.Alsoshouldbeplacedinthemiddle
                  of the sentence.
                   Bad:    Also the target users are considered.
                   Good:   The target users are also considered.
                • Donot use “that” as a connecting word.
                  Use “which”.
                   Bad:    . . . a good solution that can be computed easily.
                   Good:   . . . a good solution which can be computed easily.
                • Donot write single-sentence paragraphs.
                  Avoid writing two-sentence paragraphs. A paragraph should contain
                  at least three, if not more, sentences.
                                                                                      5

                         2.2 Avoid Austrianisms
                         I see these mistakes time and time again. Please do not let me read one of
                         them in your work.
                            • “actual” 6= “current”
                               If you mean “aktuell” in German, you probably mean “current” in
                               English.
                                Bad:   The actual selection is cancelled.
                                Good:  The current selection is cancelled.
                            • “allows to” is not English.
                                Bad:   The prototype allows to arrange components...
                                Good:  The prototype supports the arrangement of components...
                            • “enables to” is not English.
                                Bad:   it enables to recognise meanings...
                                Good:  it enables the recognition of meanings...
                            • “according” 6= “corresponding”
                                Bad:   For each browser, an according package is created.
                                Good:  For each browser, a corresponding package is created.
                            • “per default” is not English.
                               Use “by default”.
                                Bad:   Per default, the cursor is red.
                                Good:  Bydefault, the cursor is red.
                            • “As opposed to” is not English.
                               Use “In contrast to”.
                                Bad:   AsopposedtoC,Java is object-oriented.
                                Good:  In contrast to C, Java is object-oriented.
                            • “anything-dimensional” is spelt with a hyphen.
                               For example: two-dimensional, three-dimensional.
                            • “anything-based” is spelt with a hyphen.
                               For example: tree-based, location-based.
                            • “anything-oriented” is spelt with a hyphen.
                               For example: object-oriented, display-oriented.
                            • “anything-side” is spelt with a hyphen.
                         6
                                                                       2.3 Clear Writing
                  For example: client-side, server-side.
                • “anything-friendly” is spelt with a hyphen.
                  For example: user-friendly, customer-friendly.
                • “anything-to-use” is spelt with hyphens.
                  For example: hard-to-use, easy-to-use.
                • “realtime” is spelt with a hyphen if used as an adjective, or as two
                  separate words if used as a noun.
                   Bad:    . . . using realtime shadow casting.
                   Good:   . . . using real-time shadow casting.
                   Bad:    . . . display the object in realtime.
                   Good:   . . . display the object in real time.
             2.3 Clear Writing
             The written and spoken language of your thesis is English as appropriate
             for presentation to an international audience. Please take special care to
             ensure that your work is adapted to such an audience. In particular:
                • Write in a straight-forward style, using simple sentence structure.
                • Use common and basic vocabulary. For example, use “unusual” for
                  “arcane”, and “specialised” for “erudite”.
                • Brieﬂy deﬁne or explain all technical vocabulary the ﬁrst time it is
                  mentioned, to ensure that the reader understands it.
                • Explain all acronyms and abbreviations. For example, the ﬁrst time
                  an acronym is used, write it out in full and place the acronym in
                  parentheses.
                   Bad:    . . . When using the gui version, the use may...
                   Good:   . . . When using the Graphical User Interface (gui) version, the use
                           may...
                • Avoid local references. For example, not everyone knows the names of
                  all the provincial capitals of Austria. If local context is important to
                  the material, describe it fully.
                • Avoid “insider” comments. Ensure that your whole audience under-
                  stands any reference whose meaning you do not describe. For example,
                                                                                      7
            2 Language and Writing Style
              do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular
              application.
             • Donot“play on words”. For example, do not use “puns”, particularly
              in the title of a piece. Phrases such as “red herring” require cultural as
              well as technical knowledge of English.
             • Useunambiguousformatstorepresentculturally localised things such
              as times, dates, personal names, currencies, and even numbers. 9/11
              is the 9th of November in most of the world.
             • Be careful with humour. In particular, irony and sarcasm can be hard
              to detect if you are not a native speaker.
             • If you ﬁnd yourself repeating the same word or phrase too often, look
              in a thesaurus such as Roget (2004) and Roget (1995) for an alternative
              wordwith the same meaning.
            Clear writing experts recognise that part of writing understandable doc-
            uments is understanding and responding to the needs of the intended
            audience. It is the writer’s job to maintain the audience’s willingness to go
            on reading the document. Readers who are continually stumped by long
            words or offended by a pompous tone are likely to stop reading and miss
            the intended message.
            2.4 Avoiding Gender Bias
            Part of striking the right tone is handling gender-linked terms sensitively.
            Useofgendertermsiscontroversial. Some writers use the generic masculine
            exclusively, but this offends many readers. Other writers are experimenting
            with ways to make English more neutral. Avoiding gender bias in writing
            involves two kinds of sensitivity:
             1. being aware of potential bias in the kinds of observations and char-
              acterisations that it is appropriate to make about women and men,
              and
             2. being aware of certain biases that are inherent in the language and of
              howyoucanavoidthem.

                                                           2.4 Avoiding Gender Bias
            The second category includes using gender-speciﬁc nouns and pronouns
            appropriately. Here are some guidelines for handling these problems:
               • Use a gender-neutral term when speaking generically of people:
                  man                the human race
                  mankind            humankind, people
                  manpower           workforce, personnel
                  manonthestreet average person
               • Avoidclearly gender-marked titles. Use neutral terms when good ones
                 are available. For example:
                  chairman     chairperson
                  spokesman speaker, representative
                  policeman    police ofﬁcer
                  stewardess   ﬂight attendant
               • If you are speaking of the holder of a position and you know the
                 gender of the person who currently occupies the position, use the
                 appropriate gender pronoun. For example, suppose the “head nurse”
                 is a man:
                  Bad:   The head nurse must ﬁle her report every Tuesday.
                  Good:  The head nurse must ﬁle his report every Tuesday.
               • Rewrite sentences to avoid using gender pronouns. For example, use
                 the appropriate title or job name again:
                  Bad:   Interview the user ﬁrst and then ask him to ﬁll out a questionnaire.
                  Good:  Interview the user ﬁrst and then ask the user to ﬁll out a question-
                         naire.
               • To avoid using the third person singular pronoun (his or her), recast
                 your statement in the plural:
                  Bad:   Each student should bring his text to class.
                  Good:  All students should bring their texts to class.
               • Address your readers directly in the second person, if it is appropriate
                 to do so:
                  Bad:   Thestudent must send in his application by the ﬁnal deadline date.
                  Good:  Send in your application by the ﬁnal deadline date.
               • Replace third person singular possessives with articles.
                  Bad:   Every student must hand his report in on Friday.
                  Good:  Every student must hand the report in on Friday.
                                                                                9
                         2 Language and Writing Style
                            • Write your way out of the problem by using the passive voice.
                                Bad:   Each department head should do his own projections.
                                Good:  Projections should be done by each department head.
                            • Avoid writing awkward formulations such as “s/he”, “he/she”, or
                              “his/her”. They interfere when someone is trying to read a text aloud.
                               If none of the other guidelines has been helpful, use the slightly less
                               awkwardforms“heorshe”, and “his or hers”.
                         Remember, the goal is to avoid constructions that will offend your readers
                         so much as to distract them from the content of your work.
                         2.5 Titles and Headings in Initial Caps
                         2.6 Use a Spelling Checker
                         Inthesedaysofhightechnology,spellingmistakesandtyposareinexcusable.
                         It is very irritating for your supervisor to have to read through and correct
                         spelling mistake after spelling mistake which could have been caught by an
                         automated spelling checker. Believe me, irritating your supervisor is not a
                         good idea.
                         So, use a spelling checker before you hand in any version, whether it is a draft
                         or a ﬁnal version. Since this is apparently often forgotten, and sometimes
                         even wilfully ignored, let me make it absolutely clear:
                               Use a spelling checker, please.
                               Use a spelling checker!
                               Use a spelling checker, you moron.

      2.7 Use a Dictionary
      If you are not quite sure of the meaning of a word, then use a dictionary.
      dictionary.com (2004) is a free English dictionary, Chemnitz (2004) and Leo
      (2004) are two very good English-German dictionaries.
      2.8 Use a Thesaurus
      If a word has been used several times already, and using another equivalent
      word might improve the readability of the text, then consult a thesaurus.
      Roget (2004) and Roget (1995) are free English thesauri.

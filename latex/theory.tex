Refactoring is a well established concept in software development. 
Especially in complex project cleaning up code is a regular activity and is often referred to as refactoring. Despite of its familiarity, the exact definition of the term "refactoring" is not always self evident.
To avoid refering to the term too loosely, it is therefore important to give a precise definition to reference throughout the paper. 

Martin Fowler (\cite{fowler2018}) managed to formulate a definition that is both short and precise. In addition, Fowler is notably one of the most prominent figure in the field of refactoring. Fowler defines it the following:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Refactoring} is the process of changing a software system in a way that does not
alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure.\end{quote}

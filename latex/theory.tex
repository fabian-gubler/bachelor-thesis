% Defining Refactoring
% ---


Refactoring is a well established concept in software development. 
Especially in complex project, 
	cleaning up code is a regular activity and is often referred to as refactoring. 
Despite of its familiarity, 
	the exact definition of the term "refactoring" is not always self evident.
To avoid refering to the term too loosely, 
	it is therefore important to give a precise definition to reference throughout the paper. 

Martin \textcite{fowler2018} managed to formulate a definition that is both short and precise. 
Notably, Fowler is one of the most prominent figure in the field of refactoring,
	which further valides the utilization of his definition.
Fowler defines it the following:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Refactoring} is the process of changing a software system in a way 
	that does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure.
\end{quote}

To improve the internal structure means to work on the quality attributes of the program. 
It is important that quality improvements do not change the features, 
	as the exteral behavior of should remain the same. 
As a result, we can eleviate the risk associated with changing the code and not introduce new bugs.

# Project Description
Here comes a short introduction of this project.

### Open Questions
- **What is necessary for personal lab access?** This would be very convenient for me.
- **Weekly feedback sessions?** Personal + fixed day would be preferable.
- **Code Formatter and Version Control?** Important to know if there are preferences before editing your code.

# Current Milestone
- ~~list here~~

## 1. Preparatory measures
It makes sense to first take some time preparing the writing process of the thesis.
The following measures are personally useful to me by making writing more efficent and fun.

### a) Editing Setup
Latex
- [ ] Managing References with Zotero
- [x] Thesis Template and first adjustments
- [x] Latex Environment

Misc
- [x] Create this Git Repository

### b) Structuring Writing Process
- [ ] Preliminary Table of Contents
- [ ] Estimate length of sections
- [ ] Superficial Descriptions of Parts

### c) Empirical Groundwork
- [ ] Formulate Research Question
- [ ] Formulate Research Objectives


# Upcoming Milestones
## 2. Theoretical Framework
It is essential to understanding the theoretical framework of refactoring and design patterns. At the same time, get an overview of the code and relevant toolset for refactoring.
- Duration: 3 Weeks
- Deliverable: Aim to write min. 10 Pages.

### a) Research and Literature Review
- [ ] Find relevant Papers for subject matter

### b) Comprehensive Understanding of Refactoring
- [ ] Study Fowler's work and take notes
- [ ] Develop Hypotheses

### c) Toolset
- [ ] Find Software tools for different code smells
- [ ] Best Coding Practices in a refactor
- [ ] Find Metrics to evaluate refactor

## 3. Coding
This is the main part of the thesis. Code refactoring based on theoretical framework. Noting down whether hypotheses are validated and documenting the results.
- Duration: 4 Weeks
- Deliverables: Refactored codebase, (Extensive) Note-taking of results

## 4. Writing Process (Finalization)
Formulation of notes into first draft of the final paper, which will then be revised and improved upon.
- Duration: 3 Weeks

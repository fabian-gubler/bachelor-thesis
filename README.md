## 1. Preparations
It makes sense to first take some time preparing the writing process of the thesis.
The following measures are personally useful to me by making writing more efficent and fun.

~~**Structuring Writing Process**~~
- [x] Declaration of Authorship
- [x] Superficial Descriptions of Parts (see [contents](https://github.com/fabian-gubler/bachelor-thesis/blob/main/notes/contents/overview.md))
- [x] Preliminary Table of Contents

~~**Empirical Groundwork**~~
- [x] Formulate Research Question
- [x] Formulate Research Objectives

~~**Editing Setup**~~
- [x] Managing References with Zotero
- [x] Thesis Template and first adjustments
- [x] Latex Environment
- [x] Create this Git Repository

## 2. Framework
It is essential to understanding the theoretical framework of refactoring and design patterns. At the same time, get an overview of the code and relevant toolset for refactoring.
- Duration: 4 Weeks
- Deliverable: Aim to write min. 10 Pages.

~~**Research and Literature Review**~~
- [x] Find relevant Papers for subject matter

**Comprehensive Understanding of Refactoring**
- [x] Study Fowler's work and take notes
- [ ] Develop Hypotheses

**Toolset**
- [x] Find Software tools for different code smells
- [ ] Best Coding Practices in a refactor
- [x] Find Metrics to evaluate refactor


## 3. Coding
This is the main part of the thesis. Code refactoring based on theoretical framework. Noting down whether hypotheses are validated and documenting the results.
- Duration: 4 Weeks
- Deliverables: Refactored codebase, (Extensive) Note-taking of results

**Preparations**
- [ ] Create new Git Branch for active Development
- [ ] Run Software Tools for initial Analysis

## 4. Finalization
Formulation of notes into first draft of the final paper, which will then be revised and improved upon.
- Duration: 3 Weeks

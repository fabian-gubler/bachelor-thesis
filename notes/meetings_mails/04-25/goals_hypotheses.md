# Research Objectives
======================

### Research Objectives
#### Main Aim (in a narrow scope) is to do the Refactoring Process
Results: Three Main Goals which are in sequential order
1. Detection of code smells to determine flaws in code
-> Results in: Report on internal problems detected
2. Address smells with refactoring und thus improve internal state
-> Results in: Report on the success through measurment

#### NOTE: Aim is not to reworking the entire Application
Note: To rework the entire application might be out of scope. 
Therefore it would be useful to determine which parts to refactor beforehand and focus on these.
-> Validate why this is enough to make meaningful conclusions.

#### Secondary Aim: Discussion part
- Refactoring direct value contribution to the code base.
- Secondary Goal is to make an academic contribution.

3. Find appropriate measures, insights and suggestions with regards to the refactoring of a smart factory.
4. Detect potential threats to Validity of results: Measures, Degree Refactoring solved Internal Problems
5. Report on unsuspected Results as a contribution to academic literature
Formulation
NOTE: (1) and (2) cover Fowler's Definition of Refactoring

# HYPOTHESES
================

# 1. Improving Internal State
-- Statement --
Refactoring leads to an improvement in the quality of the code

-- Motivation --
- Refactoring is known to increase the quality attributes of a project
- Refactoring is my means of choice in increasing the code quality
- I want to show a link between refactoring steps and the improvement of internal state

-- Variables --
- Independent Variable: Structure of the code
- Dependent Variable: Quality Metrics

-- Testing the Hypothesis --
- Measuring the code quality with predefined metrics
- Check whether refactoring the smells makes the metrics better and thus improves quality
- Check the strength of my hypothese according to the amount of increase

-- Shortcomings --
- Sample size of n = 1
- However, the strength of improvement is what i care about
- Secondly, it is the insights that are generated by testing this hypotheses that add value to this paper (e.g. suggestions for CPS specific systems)

# 2. Alteration in External Behavior
-- Statement --
Degree of sucessfully fulfilled test requirements changes visibly based on which code smell is being refactored

-- Motivation --
- Changes in external behavior must be avoided during Refactoring in order to reduce bugs from being introduced
- Knowing which Code Smells show the most risks in introducing bugs in our cyber physical system is valuable.
- This is especially true when not having a comprehensive test suite.

-- Variables --
- Independent Variable: Code Smell (e.g. Code duplication)
- Dependent Variable: How many Test Requirement are passed & Extent of Debugging

-- Testing the Hypothesis
- Testing whether requirements are fulfilled after each Code Smell that is refactored
- Start running tests early on in the first refactoring steps to avoid needing to revert to previous state (due to too much alteration in external behavior)

-- Shortcomings --
- Again sample size of n = 1
- One Code smell might introduce no bugs in our project, but does the opposite in another
- The indications can then be examined in future works

## 3. Smart Factory Suggestions
NOTE: This hypothesis i am at least happy about, as I find it difficult to falsify.

-- Statement --
Refactoring cyper physical systems differs from refactoring other software systems.

Areas: Relevance of certain quality attribute, prone to a code smell, importance of refactoring itself

-- Motivation --
- In our paper, we want to find peculiarities of cps systems
- In the discussion section of the paper compare my insights with other sources (i.e. "Do you smell it too" paper)
- My paper as a  contribution to find similarities too see where cps systems differ from other software projects
- These findings can be further proven / disproven in future works

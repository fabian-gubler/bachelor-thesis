# Introduction
## Goal of the thesis
This bachelor thesis addresses the problem of finding the most appropriate refactoring suggestions for projects in industry 4.0 with a particular focus on Smart factories.
- Aim is creating general insights that can be applied to most Smart Factory projects.
- Having a lot of possible approaches to improve code, it is needed to find which methods are particularly of interest in improving smart factory systems. This can be done by having the characteristics of such systems in mind (e.g. Safety concerns)

# Exploration of the fourth industrial revolution
This part puts the entire topic in a broader context.
## Terminology and Context
- Key Terminology
- What is it and what is it not
- Relevance within Computer Science
- Current progress and applications

## Defining Smart Factories
- Explanation

## Economic Relevance
- Business Processes and automation
- Future Relevance for economy
- Current use cases show the relevance (e.g. Amazon)
- Automation is a very relevant topic
- User Friendliness: Not everyone has digital literacy, can code

# Theoretical Framework for Code Refactoring
## Background
- What is it?
- Why do we need it?
- When do we need it?
- Different levels of a refactor: From small programs to entire software stack / architecture

## Formalisation of Design Patterns
- Refactoring as a process of getting rid of code smells
- List and explain Design Pattern, Anti-Patterns
- Established Practices of patterns and different degree of impact
- Software Modularity
- Consequences

## The Business Case for Refactoring 
- Technical Debt: Cost benefit analysis
- Worst case: Code dinosaurs, unmaintainable code
- Difficulties in convincing clients, due to not delivering direct results
- Find Case Studies of prominent firms

## Thesis Context
Fourth industrial revolutions demands a greater focus on refactoring.
- Involved Costs: Having Bugs with software controlling factories can lead to immense costs (e.g. downtime).
- Limitations of CPS: In comparison to typical software project, the debugging and testing of smart factories requires a lot of time and costs. Eventhough one needs to spend more time in the beginning, well thought out refactoring can save a lot of time in the end.
- Security Concerns: Industrial Cyper-physical systems can be dangerous. Bugs in code base  can lead to damaging the machines and in the worst case even physical injuries.

There are no right ways to write clean code, there are many different approaches
- Best practices: What are the best ways concerning refactoring and design patterns when applied to smart factories. 
- Consistencies: Are there perceivable consistencies that can be applied to all projects in this field?

Smart Factories are inherently object-oriented and thus demand previous modeling
- Factory Components: The Components of the smart factory are objects with component-specific methods .
- Reusability of Code: OOP enables reusing code within the project. One can duplicating instances and reuse code for similar objects or subclasses.


# Methodological approach

Note: To rework the entire application might be out of scope. Therefore it would be useful to determine which parts to refactor beforehand and focus on these.
- First through a Literature Review hypotheses are constructed of what clean code looks like within industry 4.0 
- Effectiveness of theory and hypotheses is directly tested by application on the smart factory project. 
- Success of the result will be determined by using metrics (prone to errors, interoperability, extensibility etc.)

## Motivation and Procedure
- Creating and evaluating hypotheses
- Priority and Goals of my Project
- Apart from scienticif metrics, what are more personal objectives of this paper
- What research problem or question I investigate?
- Desired Findigs: Code is easier to read and maintain


## Means of data collection
- First and foremost: Rough Overview with tools
- Plan, Do, Check, Act
Describe with what tools (hardware and software) I am constrained to do this project.
- Fischer Fabrik
- Python
- Software Architecture
- Controller Interface of Smart Factory
- Describe Code Project

## Methods of analysis
- Software tools
- Metrics
- Best practices
- Reference projects?

## Limitations
Evaluate and justify your methodological choices
- Cite relevant sources
- Discuss obstactles
- Specific constraints (see means of work) which are hard to reproduce
- Not having written the code myself
- Not direct translatable to huge factories or even similar projects
- Tools only get you so far. Expert Knowledge required for complex tasks
- How good are these metrics, well established?

# Main Findings
This results chapter objectively reports the findings, presenting only brief observations in relation to each question or hypothesis. It should not give an overall answer to the main research question or speculate on the meaning of the results.

# Discussion

- Unsuspected Results and Obstacles
- Threats to Validity

# Status Quo
## Tasks completed since last Meeting
Preliminary
- Finding relevant literature and get an overview of topic
- Formulate Research Question and Research Objectives

Main: Theoretical Framework & Methodology
- Research
- Note-Taking
- Structuring
- Writing Process started

## Changes & Challenges
- Extended Framework phase from 3 to 4 Weeks
- Write Exploration Chapter only if enough pages left (in the end)
	- Reason: Relevance of the parts in Theoretical Framework (e.g. Concept of technical debt, Relationship between Refactoring and Smells)
	- When: After Coding in the "Finalization" Part, Can Also be Only 5 Pages as an introduction for the reader.

## Personal reflection
- **Past**: Having ups and downs - Notetaking and Research felt very efficient, but needed time to get into the writing process (better now).
- **Future Objectives**: Goals of completing Framework by end of next weeks seems doable. It is however hard to estimate the speed of writing.
- **Challenge**: Need to be careful to define scope of methodology not to overburden myself.
	- i.e. better to do less tasks very well, than a bunch of tasks mediocre
- **Topic**: Surprisingly interested in the topic, had a pleasure reading fowler's work.

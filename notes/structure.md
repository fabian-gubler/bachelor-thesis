# Categorization of the topic
## Economic Relevance of Smart Factories
- Future Relevance for economy
- Current use cases show the relevance (e.g. Amazon)
- Automation is a very relevant topic
- User Friendliness: Not everyone has digital literacy, can code

## Topic Explained
- Key Terminology
- What is it and what is it not
- Relevance within Computer Science
- Current progress and applications

## Literature Review
Smart Factory and Fourth Industrial Revolution
- What is the current state of the field?
- Is it relatively new or saturated with insights?
- What are the current challenges and research objectives

# Theoretical Framework
## Business Case for Refactoring
- Technical Debt: Cost benefit analysis
- Worst case: Code dinosaurs, unmaintainable code
- Difficulties in convincing clients, due to not delivering direct results
- Find Case Studies of prominent firms

## Refactoring
- What is it?
- Why do we need it?
- When do we need it?
- Different levels of a refactor: From small programs to entire software stack / architecture

## Concrete Theory
- Refactoring as a process of getting rid of code smells
- List and explain Design Pattern, Anti-Patterns
- Established Practices of patterns and different degree of impact
- Software Modularity
- Consequences

# Methodology

## Object/means of the work
- Fischer Fabrik
- Python
- Software Architecture
- Controller Interface of Smart Factory
- Describe Code Project

## Procedure
- First and foremost: Rough Overview with tools
- Plan, Do, Check, Act

## Toolset
- Software tools
- Metrics
- Best practices
- Reference projects?

## Academic Approach
- Creating and evaluating hypotheses
- Priority and Goals of my Project

## Limitations of the approach
- Not having written the code myself
- Not direct translatable to huge factories
- Tools only get you so far. Expert Knowledge required for complex tasks

## Desired Findings
- Code is easier to read and maintain

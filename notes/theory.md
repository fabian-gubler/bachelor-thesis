- Relevance within Computer Science
- Current progress and applications

## Literature Review
Smart Factory and Fourth Industrial Revolution
- What is the current state of the field?
- Is it relatively new or saturated with insights?
- What are the current challenges and research objectives

# Theoretical Framework
## Business Case for Refactoring
- Technical Debt: Cost benefit analysis
- Worst case: Code dinosaurs, unmaintainable code
- Difficulties in convincing clients, due to not delivering direct results
- Find Case Studies of prominent firms

## Refactoring
- What is it?
- Why do we need it?
- When do we need it?
- Different levels of a refactor: From small programs to entire software stack / architecture

## Code Smells
- We refactor to get rid of code smells
- List and explain
- Consequences

# Methodology

## Object/means of the work
- Fischer Fabrik
- Python
- Architecture

## Academic Approach
- Creating and evaluating hypotheses
- Priority and Goals of my Project

## Limitations of the approach
- Not direct translatable to huge factories

## Desired Findings
- Code is easier to read and maintain

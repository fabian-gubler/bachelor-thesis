# Refactoring

- Formatting and Linting is also a part of the Quality of the Code
- Testing that functionalities did not change
	- Testing should be relatively simple, as there is not much ambiguity (e.g. sorting works)
	- No errors
	- This enables me to refactor at home and in the session at st. gallen i can test compatibility
	- Quality Metrics are also independent of the machine

# Design Patterns
  - Code Duplication

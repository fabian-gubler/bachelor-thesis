# Refactoring

- Formatting and Linting is also a part of the Quality of the Code
- Testing that functionalities did not change
	- Testing should be relatively simple, as there is not much ambiguity (e.g. sorting works)
	- No errors
	- This enables me to refactor at home and in the session at st. gallen i can test compatibility
	- Quality Metrics are also independent of the machine

# Design Patterns
  - Code Duplication

# Personal Findings
Clean Code
- Sedgewick (p. 413): Import statements appear at the beginning of a program, with all standard Python modules appearing before all user-defined modules.

Data abstraction
- Sedgewick (p. 674): Whenever you can clearly separate data and associated operations within a computation, you should do so.

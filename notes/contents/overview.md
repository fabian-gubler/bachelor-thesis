# Introduction
## Goal of the thesis
This bachelor thesis addresses the problem of finding the most appropriate refactoring suggestions for projects in industry 4.0 with a particular focus on Smart factories.
- Aim is creating general insights that can be applied to most Smart Factory projects.
- Having a lot of possible approaches to improve code, it is needed to find which methods are particularly of interest in improving smart factory systems. This can be done by having the characteristics of such systems in mind (e.g. Safety concerns)
